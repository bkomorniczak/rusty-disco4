Dilophosaurus was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs and the largest known land-animal in North America at the time.
It was slender and lightly built, and the skull was proportionally large, but delicate.
The snout was narrow, and the upper jaw had a gap or kink below the nostril.
It had a pair of longitudinal, arched crests on its skull; their complete shape is unknown, but they were probably enlarged by keratin.
The mandible was slender and delicate at the front, but deep at the back. The teeth were long, curved, thin, and compressed sideways.
Those in the lower jaw were much smaller than those of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had serrations at their front and back edges.
The neck was long, and its vertebrae were hollow, and very light. The arms were powerful, with a long and slender upper arm bone.
The hands had four fingers; the first was short but strong and bore a large claw, the two following fingers were longer and slenderer with smaller claws; the fourth was vestigial.
The thigh bone was massive, the feet were stout, and the toes bore large claws. The skull of Dilophosaurus was large in proportion to the overall skeleton, yet delicate.
The snout was narrow in front view, becoming narrower towards the rounded top. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was long and low when seen from the side, bulbous at the front, and its outer surface became less convex from snout to naris (bony nostril).
